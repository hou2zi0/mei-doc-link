## MEI Documentation Links
Provides automatic linking of element names in code snippets to their respective page within the MEI-XML documentation using JavaScript.

Also works, of course, in the context of “normal” web pages, e.g. see live demo [here](https://hou2zi0.github.io/mei-doc-link/examples/example.html).

It also provides a simple CSS stylesheet to mimic the Atom dark theme. The classes used by the CSS are applied by JavaScript and are as follows:

* `span.delimiters`
* `span.element`
* `span.attribute`
* `span.value`
* `span.comment-string`
* `a.mei-doc-link`
* `code.xml.mei-doc-link`

When `lineNumbering` is set to `true`, the following markup applies as well:

* `span.line-numbering`
* `span.code-line`

N.B.: Third party libraries may provide their own markup and classes. Thus there’s a possibility that the CSS gets scrambled, when too many libraries work on the codes snippets.

N.b.: The file in the `JS` folder is going to be (mostly) stable. Development work will be carried out in `dev`.

## Usage
### Overview
Include the JavaScript file at the bottom of your HTML page.  Just before that, you may provide the class names of the code snippets, where you want to link to the TEI documentation in the constant variable `MEI_DOC_LINK` .

N.b.: by default the CSS and the JS files
* expect the classes `xml mei-doc-link` on the element `<code>`
* and apply the `document.getElementsByClassName()` selector method.

When `MEI_DOC_LINK` is not provided, it will be  set as `xml mei-doc-link` automatically. You may switch to the `document.querySelectorAll()` selector method by setting the `querySelectorAll` property in `MEI_DOC_LINK_CONFIG` to `true` (see below). When you switch the selector method, you must also provide a valid query in `MEI_DOC_LINK`, e.g. `pre code.xml.highlight`.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://hou2zi0.github.io/mei-doc-link/CSS/mei-documentation-links.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <pre><code class="xml mei-doc-link">&lt;note pname=&quot;b&quot; oct=&quot;4&quot; dur=&quot;8&quot; xml:id=&quot;m259_s1_n1&quot; artic=&quot;acc&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>
  […]
    <script>
      const MEI_DOC_LINK = `xml mei-doc-link`;
      const MEI_DOC_LINK_CONFIG = {
        "querySelectorAll": false,
        "lineNumbering": true
      }
    </script>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="https://hou2zi0.github.io/mei-doc-link/JS/mei-documentation-links.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Query selector options

To switch to the `document.querySelectorAll()` selector method set `MEI_DOC_LINK_CONFIG.querySelectorAll = true`. Don’t forget to provide a valid query, e.g. `pre code.xml.highlight`.

```html
<script>
  const MEI_DOC_LINK = `pre code.xml.highlight`;
  const MEI_DOC_LINK_CONFIG = {
    "querySelectorAll": true
  }
</script>
```

### Language options

No language options available yet, because afaik the MEI documentation is currently only available in English.

May me implemented as shown [here](https://github.com/hou2zi0/tei-doc-link#language-options).


### What elements will be linked?

Every element name recognized as such by the regular expression will be linked to its assumed MEI documentation page, regardless of its actual existence.

Attribute names are not yet linked to their respective pages, because these pages do not exist yet in the documentation and linking to the attributes section within their respective element’s documentation page is not possible, because of missing IDs.

It may however be implemented as shown [here](https://github.com/hou2zi0/tei-doc-link#what-elements-and-attributes-will-be-linked).


### Examples

When it works, it should look like this:

![Code Snippet with links to MEI documentation and dark theme](data/img/Abb_1.png)

![Link from element name to MEI documentation](data/img/Abb_2.png)

The simple example shows the built-in line numbering feature.  The corresponding live example may be found  [here](https://hou2zi0.github.io/mei-doc-link/examples/example.html).

## To Do

* Provide possibility to switch between languages of TEI documentation (via “Configuration object”), as soon as  multi language documentation is available.
* Link attribute names to their respective url fragments or IDs, when available.
* Refactor to a more formal functional style.
